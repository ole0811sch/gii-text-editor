# gii-text-editor

## Description
gii-text-editor is a very basic text editor for the Casio fx-9860GII. The project is currently WIP and there a many essential features that are either incomplete or missing.

## About the languages used
Apart from the make files, all source code is written as C99 code. However, since the compiler provided by Casio only supports C89, but does support C++, they are compiled as C++ source files.
